# compsci

This repo is just me messing around with algorithms, design patterns, etc. If it's of use to someone, even better!

Each piece of code is unit tested and benchmarked to get a feel for efficiency.

Right now everyting is in Go, but I may add Python or JavaScript in the future if I have time.
